# CME: ChatGPT Material Explorer 1.0  

**CME 1.0** is a domain-specific custom GPT on the GPT-4o architecture. CME is developed with several key objectives in mind: (1) lowering the barrier to entry for AI-assisted materials research, (2) integrating experimental and computational data pipelines, and (3) reducing the risk of hallucination by interfacing with real-time databases and using physics-aware modeling approaches with many more potential additions in the future.

There are no limits to the types of questions you can ask Material Explorer. Below are just a few examples. You can also engage in an iterative conversation, asking follow-up questions or requesting explanations of the results.

1. Find all materials containing Carbon (C) and Silicon (Si) in the JARVIS-DFT database and their total number. Present in table format.
2. Find all materials containing Carbon (C) and Silicon (Si) in the C2DB database and their total number. Present in table format.
3. Find all materials containing chemical formula MoS2 in the JARVIS-DFT database and their total number. Present in table format. (Note chemical formula should be alphabetically ordered, so O2Si not SiO2)
4. Predict properties of this Poscar file using ALIGNN for atomic structure: MySytem
